Purpose
-------

This is a quick guide on how to setup and run this UVM based I2C TB. 

The project was done using Mentor Graphics Questasim 10.1. 


TB structure 
-------------
                                               
                                              (wb)
                             a1                DUT
                             |                  |
                             --------------------  I2C Bus
                              |     |    |    |
                              a2    a3   a4   a5

 wb = wishbone agent.
 ax = iic agent

The wb agent runs the master sequences that drive the DUT via the DUT's wishbone interface.

The a1 agent is used to run master sequences to create cross traffic. 

Agents a2, a3, a4 and a5 are used to run slave sequences that respond to the master sequences
running on the a1 and wb agents. 

The tests included in this delivery use a2 and a4 to run slave transmit sequences and a3 and
a5 to run slave receive sequences. The slave addresses of a2 and a3, and of a4 and a5 may be 
identical, but the addresses of a2 and a3 cannot be the same as those of a4 and a5. In other 
words a2 and a3 can be, but don't have to be, 'one' device, and a4 and a5 can be, but don't 
have to be, 'one' device. Master a1 and wb randomly communicate with a matching sequence on
a2-a5. This address allocation is controlled via constraints and can be changed to any other
desired scheme.
      

Directory Overview
------------------
The directory structure generally follows that recommended in Mentor's cookbook.

For a tree view please refer to the "tree.txt" located in this directory.


iic
|-- agents
|   |-- iic_agent

    All files relating to the I2C agents used by the TB to communicate with the DUT, and  
    to create background traffic.
|   |
|   `-- wb_agent
    The agent that is used to drive the DUT via the DUT's wishbone interface.

|-- iic_tb
|   |-- env
    Contains the iic_env.svh file, which is the top level of the class based part of the testbench. 
    It also contains the virtual sequencer that is used to run sequences to coordinate the wb and 
    iic agents sequences, as well as the scoreboard that decides whether the data transferred across 
    the bus is correct or not.
|   |
|   |-- register_model
    Not implemented due to lack of time.
|   |
|   |-- sequences
    All sequences used by the testbench.The sequences that run on the wb agent start with "wb", those that
    run on the iic agents start with "iic" and the virtual sequences that run on the virtual sequencer
    contain "vseq" in their names.
|   |
|   |-- sim
    Simulation directory. Contains all scripts used to compile the project and run simulations.
|   |   |
|   |   |-- coverage
        Directory to which coverage information is written when regressions are run.
|   |   |
|   |   |-- run_dirs
        When a test is run it will create a test subdirectory, individual to the test, in this directory and
        run the simulation in that directory.     
|   |   |
|   |   `-- work
        Compiled libraries.
|   |   |
|   `-- test
    Directory containing test source code directories.
|   |   |

|-- rtl
    DUT RTL source code.

Set-up
-------

Change the $PROJECTS variable in the compile script to point to where you've untared the testbench. 
The path to the compile script is iic/tb/sim/compile


What's randomised controlled by constraints.
------------------------------------------

1.  The type of the transfer (read/write).
2.  The length of the transfer.
3.  If arbitration occours or not.
4.  Slave clock stretching.
5.  The speed of the transfer.
6.  The SCL frequency of each participant.
7.  The addresses addressed by the masters.
8.  The addresses of the slaves.
9.  The number of frames.
10. The ACK/NACK probability.
11. Master's reaction to NACK.
12. Whether the bus is released at the
    end of a transfer (STOP vs Re-START). 
13. The delay between frames.
14. The presence and density of cross traffic.


Individual Tests
----------------

Setup to work with Mentor's Questasim.

1. Change to the simulation directory.

cd iic/iic_tb/sim

2. Compile

./compile

3. Run test.

Using the iicMasterTxTest (located in iic/iic_tb/test), and a seed value of 4 as an example :

vsim  +UVM_TESTNAME=iicMasterTxTest -cvg63 -coverage -debugDB  +UVM_VERBOSITY=UVM_NONE  -sv_seed 4 -do run.do top_opt

For more transcript information change the verbosity level to UVM_FULL.


Regression
----------

Setup to work with Mentor's Questasim.

1. Change to the simulation directory.

cd iic/iic_tb/sim

2. Compile

./compile

3. Run the regression. The regression has been configured to run each available test with 10 different seeds. The 
   results will be written to the run_dirs sub-directory. All coverage information will be written to the coverage
   subdirectory. The coverage information from the individual tests will automatically be merged at the end of 
   the regression run.Waveforms of each test will be automatically saved in the tests run directory.

./run_all.pl

4. Report results.

./report.pl

5. View result log files

cd results_dir/<TestName>_<seed>
emacs run.log

6. View result wave files

cd results_dir/<TestName>_<seed>
./viewWave

7. Viewing and analyzing coverage once the regression has finished.

vsim -viewcov coverage/merged.ucdb &


Drop Offs
---------

1. Some seeds for some tests will cause fails. It would need to be investigated whether this is due to bugs in the
   test/testbench or the DUT.

2. The situation of arbitration in the Master Rx versus Master Rx case has been constrained to arbitration in the 
   address part of the transfer. When arbitration continues beyond the address byte and the frames are of unequal
   length, then the master that finished its read first can legitimately start another transfer whilst the other
   master is still carrying on with its read. It seems to me that this is a corner case not addressed by the I2C
   standard.

3. The DUT RTL had to be slightly modified. Using the original code led to situations where the DUT would sometimes
   start transfers during ongoing cross traffic transfers. This was due to the delay in the bus busy information
   reaching the wb master sequence and the delay in making the wishbone write to initiate a transfer. The scenario
   being that the wb master sequence checks if the bus is free and initiating a transfer, only for the cross traffic
   to start a transfer in the meanwhile, and this transfer having gone beyond the start bit by the time that the 
   DUT transfer starts up.
